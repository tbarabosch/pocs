# CVE-2018-14775

This is a DoS in the OpenBSD kernel (OpenBSD 6.3/6.2) that yields a triple fault. It can be triggered by an unprivileged user. The issue was anounced in [OpenBSD 6.3 errata 015](https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/6.3/common/015_ioport.patch.sig) and assigned [CVE-2018-14775](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2018-14775). There is a [very detailed write-up](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/the-history-of-a-security-hole/) of the issue by Michal Necasek, who discovered the same bug around the same time as I did.
